# Coursera_Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Goal of the project:
1. Prepare a tidy data set 
2. Create a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis 
3. Write a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4. Include a README.md in the repo with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Initial data:
the data originates from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and the dataset can be found here [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
